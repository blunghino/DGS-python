 dgs_wav.py

Python software to calculate the grain size distribution from an image of sediment or other granular material

To run the program, download and unzip, open a terminal or your Python development environment (e.g. IDLE, Spyder), cd to the DGS-master directory, then execute the program (for example in the command window type):

python dgs_wav.py /my/sediment/images/directory

This program implements the algorithm of
